# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple **Flappy Bird** game made using **Unity** and **C#**.  
I created this project to understand basic game development concepts like player movement, collision detection, and scoring.

## About the Game

The player controls a bird and tries to fly it through gaps between pipes.  
If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game ends.  
Each time the bird passes through the pipes, the score increases.

## Features

- 2D gameplay
- Pipe obstacles
- Score system
- Basic collision detection
- Simple user interface
